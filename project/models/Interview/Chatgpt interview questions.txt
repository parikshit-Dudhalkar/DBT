Here’s a set of technical interview questions and answers based on the Infosys Snowflake Developer job description.
---
1. Snowflake Architecture
Q: Can you explain Snowflake's architecture?
A: Snowflake follows a multi-cluster, shared-data architecture. It separates storage, compute, and services, 
    allowing independent scaling. Data is stored in a compressed columnar format on cloud storage, while compute power 
    is provided through virtual warehouses. The cloud services layer manages metadata, authentication, and optimization.
---
2. Virtual Warehouses & Autoscaling
Q: What is a Virtual Warehouse in Snowflake, and how does autoscaling work?
A: A Virtual Warehouse (VW) is a compute resource used for query execution in Snowflake. 
  It can scale horizontally (adding clusters in multi-cluster mode) and vertically (increasing warehouse size). 
  'Autoscaling enables Snowflake to add or suspend clusters automatically based on workload demands.
---
3. Micro-Partitions & Clustering
Q: What are micro-partitions in Snowflake, and why are they important?
A: Micro-partitions are compressed columnar storage units, automatically created when data is loaded into a table. 
   They help in pruning unnecessary data, improving query performance.
   
Q: When should you use table clustering in Snowflake?
A: Clustering is needed when queries frequently filter data on non-natural clustering keys, ensuring better pruning and faster execution. 
   If queries scan too many micro-partitions, clustering should be implemented.
---
4. Performance Optimization & Query Profile
Q: How do you analyze and optimize queries in Snowflake?
A: Use Query Profile to examine execution steps, pruning, join operations, and query execution time. Optimization strategies include:
Choosing the right cluster key
Using materialized views
Leveraging result caching
Using CTEs instead of subqueries
Ensuring proper data partitioning
---
5. Materialized Views & Time Travel
Q: What are the benefits of Materialized Views in Snowflake?
A: Materialized Views store precomputed results for frequently used queries, reducing query execution time. 
However, they incur costs due to auto-refreshing.
Q: How does Time Travel work in Snowflake?
A: Time Travel allows querying historical data using the AT or BEFORE clause. It supports restoring deleted or modified data. 
   The retention period is 1-90 days, depending on the Snowflake edition.
---
6. SnowPipe, Streams, and Stages
Q: How does SnowPipe work for real-time data loading?
A: SnowPipe enables continuous data ingestion from cloud storage using auto-ingest. 
  It loads data in micro-batches without manual intervention, reducing compute costs.
Q: What are Streams in Snowflake?
A: Streams track changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in a table for CDC (Change Data Capture) operations.
Q: What is the difference between Named Stages and Internal Stages?
A:
Internal Stages are managed by Snowflake (USER, TABLE, INTERNAL).
Named Stages are explicitly created by users and offer more flexibility in managing staged data.
---
7. Query Performance Tuning
Q: What are some techniques for improving Snowflake query performance?
A:
1. Leverage Result Cache – Snowflake caches results for 24 hours.
2. Micro-partition Pruning – Optimize WHERE clause filtering.
3. Choose an optimal Cluster Key – For better partition pruning.
4. Use Materialized Views – For repetitive aggregations.
5. Use Proper Joins – Avoid cartesian joins and prefer hash joins.
6. Optimize Virtual Warehouse Size – Scale compute based on workload.
---
8. Python & Data Pipelines
Q: How do you build a data pipeline in Snowflake using Python?
A: Using Snowflake Connector for Python, you can extract, transform, and load (ETL) data. Example:
import snowflake.connector 
conn = snowflake.connector.connect( 
    user='your_user', 
    password='your_password', 
    account='your_account' 
) 
cur = conn.cursor() 
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM my_table LIMIT 10") 
for row in cur.fetchall(): 
    print(row) 
cur.close() 
conn.close()
Q: What are some Python libraries used for Data Processing in Snowflake?
A:
pandas, numpy – Data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
snowflake-connector-python – Query execution
sqlalchemy – ORM for Snowflake

9. Zero Copy Cloning & Data Sharing
Q: What is Zero Copy Cloning in Snowflake?
A: It allows creating instant copies of tables, schemas, or databases without duplicating storage.
Q: How does Data Sharing work in Snowflake?
A: Snowflake enables secure data sharing between accounts without moving or copying data, using Secure Views or Secure Data Sharing.
---
10. Advanced SQL & Recursive Queries
Q: Write a recursive query in Snowflake to find an employee hierarchy.
A:
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, EmployeeName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL  -- Top-Level Manager
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.EmployeeName
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
This fetches the employee hierarchy using recursive CTEs.

HR & Behavioral Questions
11. General HR Questions
Q: Why do you want to join Infosys?
A: Infosys is a leader in cloud and data engineering, offering an opportunity to work with advanced Snowflake implementations. 
   The company fosters innovation, and I want to contribute by leveraging my SQL, Snowflake, and Python expertise.
   
Q: Describe a challenging project you worked on.
A: In my last role, I worked on a complex data pipeline in Snowflake, where performance issues were impacting ETL jobs. 
   By optimizing query structures, selecting the right cluster keys, and implementing SnowPipe, we improved query performance by 40%.

Q: How do you handle tight deadlines?
A: I prioritize tasks, break them into manageable components, and collaborate with stakeholders. In a recent project, 
   I reduced ETL processing time by 30% by analyzing query execution plans and using materialized views.
