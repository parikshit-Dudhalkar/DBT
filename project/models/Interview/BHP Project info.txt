Creating Calender
 
	Calender = var mindate=year(min(trif[date]))
	var maxdate=year(max(trif[date]))
	Return
	AddColumne(
	filter( CalenderAuto(),
	year([Date])>mindate,
	year([Date])<year(Today))
	)
	,"EOM", EOM([Date],0),
	"Monthodyear",FORMAT([Date],"MMM-YYYY")
	)
	 
 
table graph line tree map
 
 
 
Loading all the table from database such as snowflake, joining them with the help of EventId and some with Date
Creating calender from calender function . Also creating EOMONTH for all dates
We can use calenderauto as well
 
Creating Datefilter table-
 
	by using union operator we created Filter table which can we use as calender where we have ytd, lastmonth,currentmonth,last 6 days
	 
	 DateFilter = 
var _Today=TODAY()
var _EOPMonth = EOMONTH(_Today,-1)
var _EO1PMonth = EOMONTH(_Today,-2)
var _CurrQuarterStart = DATE ( YEAR ( _Today), ROUNDUP ( DIVIDE ( MONTH ( _Today ),3 ),0 ) *3 -2, 1)
var _CurrQuarterEnd = EOMONTH ( _CurrQuarterStart,2 )
var _PrevQuarterDate = _CurrQuarterStart-95
var _FYStartDate = DATE(Year(_Today)-1,7,1)
var _LFYStartDate = DATE(Year(_Today)-2,7,1)
var _CurrentFYYear = IF(MONTH(_Today) >= 7 ,YEAR(_Today),YEAR(_Today)-1)
var _PreviousFYTD = DATE(_CurrentFYYear-1,7,1)
var _CurrentFY = DATE(_CurrentFYYear,7,1) 
var _CurrentFYEnd = DATE(_CurrentFYYear+1,7,1)-1

RETURN

	I derived KPI's from Event Id , KPI such as CCV Non Compliance (Critical control Verifications),
	How many event have are from Hazard category
	How many actions are open and closed and overdue, by calculating event id where status code = overdue 
	How many injuries are recorded , what are the total significant incident ,homany many are open,
	Total incident, how many incident are overdue
	this all are 
	
1st page Summary
2nd page Quality
	Here we calculated how many event are completed for Quality category
	How many field leadership activity event for quality event category
	created stacked column chart with month-year on x-axis and count of event Id 
	with Quality category in Y-axis and event type of legend
	 
	concatMonthYear = CONCATENATE(LEFT(Event[Date Reported].[Month],3),CONCATENATE("-",RIGHT(Event[Date Reported].[Year],2))) and used filter for fiscal year
	 
	Also created clusterd bar chart for Quality event by top 5 workgroup by event count with filter as event category as quality
	Also created Treemap of count event id by Event Type
	Also ctreated detailed report with event id, date reported, its status , its department and summary

Same page3 we created for Hazards
 
 
 
Action page 4
	KPI -- Closed Action, Open Action, Due within 7 days , Overdue Action
	Also created charts and tables
	Bar chart - Action due within 7 days
	Bar chart-- Action overdue by work group
	Management, sales&marketting, Legal,
	 
	Column chart - count of action events by monthyear on each status
	Also created action overdue and open list
	 
Injury/Illness -Page 5

	In this page 


	KPI - Day since last injury Recorded till today
	Recordable Injury/Illness
	Total Injury
	 
	Stacked column chart -- Number of Injury to the yearmonth by Injury Type Name
	Injury type -- Not work related, First Aid, Lost Time,medical treatment, restricted work
	 
	bar chart - Number of Injuries by Mechanism- exposure to heat and cold, contact with chemical , hit by moving object
	TreeMap - Count of body part by injury category
	 
	Scatter Plot-
	 
	 Used Switch statement with Body Part column as swtich column a
	 It returns the result depending on  value of expression
	 created scatter plot with giving manual co-ordinates for each body part and giving count of each Injury ID in size
	 

	 
 Incidents - page 6
 
	 Here KPI- Days since last significant incident - count days 
	 Total significant incident - count 
	 Near Miss incident -count
	 Reportable incident - govermental filter 
	 Incident resolution per days 
	 Graphs - 
	 status count of incident event by event id and category filter = status is inprogress or open to each month year and status as legend 
	  status count of incident resolved  event by event id and category filter = status is inprogress , closed, in progress, pending
	  to each resolution status like within 7 days , within 15 days, overdue, overdue  within  15 days 
	  Top 5 incident  status  by workgroup 
	  Also detailed table of all this event

	In my recent project, I worked with a mining company in Australia, where we developed a range of reports to enhance safety and operational transparency. 
	One of the key reports I created was the "Hill Safety Report" This report was designed to capture and display various events that occurred within the
	mining operations, classified by different categories and departments.

	We tracked multiple event types, such as activities, actions taken, hazards identified, injuries, and incidents. 
	The aim was to provide a clear and comprehensive view of the safety and events within the organization.
	For more insights, we include stacked column charts, bar charts,and scatter plots to analyze incidents by category, department, and event type. 
	We also focused on key performance indicators like the number of days since the last incident, total injury counts, and incident resolution rate,
	which were presented as KPIs for easy tracking.



	For Filter we created one filter column where we calculate various date range based on  the current date , making it flexible  and adaptable.
	I used DAX functions to handle complex calculations, such as determining days since the last significant event, analyzing day since the incident is open 
	in incident resolution times, and segmenting data by status (open, in progress, resolved). 
	The report also featured interactive filters, allowing users to drill down by different workgroups or incident categories.

	On the backend, I was responsible for fetching the required data from our SQL database. I wrote complex SQL queries to extract 
	and aggregate the data, which involved joining multiple tables, using subqueries, and performing calculations to ensure that the 
	data was accurate and ready for visualization. The SQL queries helped me handle large datasets and provided the foundation for the Power BI reports.
	Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my skills in both Power BI for data visualization and SQL for data extraction and manipulation. 
	The result was a user-friendly, insighful reporting tool that helped stakeholders in the mining industry monitor and improve safety measures effectively.




	Q1. How did you calculate Resolution Rate (Days)

--> 	
		sum of events we calculated by DateDiff between Event Date reported and closed date , if closed date is blank  then currentDate

		After that we calculate Resolution Rate 
	    sum of event date = DATEDIFF(Event[Date Reported],IF(Event[Closed Date] = BLANK(),TODAY(),Event[Closed Date]),DAY)
		Resoltion Rate (Days) = SUM(Event[sum of event date])/ DISTINCTCOUNT(Event[Event Id])


	Q2. How did you calculated Significant day since last incident happened?

-->
		Max of event date and current date dateDiff


	Q3. What Filter column you have created , explain in detailed

-->		

		This DAX code creates a calculated table in Power BI that enables dynamic date filtering by defining key date variables using functions

		like `TODAY()`, `EOMONTH()`, and `DATE()`. It utilizes the `UNION` function to combine multiple date ranges, each defined by `ADDCOLUMNS`, 

		resulting in filters for various time frames: **Current Week**, **Last Week**, **Month-to-Date (MTD)**, **Last 30 Days**, 

		**Previous 31 Days**, **Yesterday**, **Today**, **Previous 7 Days**, **Last Month**, **Current Quarter**, **Last Quarter**,

		**Last Year (Fiscal Year)**, **Year-to-Date (YTD)**, and **Enter Dates**. Each entry in the table includes the fields 

		**"Filter"** for the time period label and **"Order"** for sorting, facilitating effective time-based data segmentation 

		and enhancing reporting capabilities for deeper insights.														
 
 

	Q4. How did you calculate Total Injury Count
	
-->		
		Row count injuries = COUNTROWS(INJURIES)+0
		
		
	Q5.
	
	
	

	Q6. Can you provide a brief overview of the “Hill Safety Report” project and its main objectives?
	
	Q7. What were the key challenges you faced during this project, and how did you overcome them?
	
	
	Q8. How did you decide which types of charts (stacked column, bar, scatter plots) to use for different data insights?

-->
		We need to calculate Stacked column chart to identify how many days since incidents are open , so we first created calculated column
		so that we will have group such as Incident within 7 days , Within 15 days,  within 30 days. And so on,
		Days_open = IF(Event[Closed Date] = BLANK(),TODAY()-Event[Date Reported],Event[Closed Date]-Event[Date Reported])
		this we use to get number of days, which we used later as a criteria.
		
		Other chart we created was Incident By date and status . We extract year-month from date and use this in x -axis
		
		For y-axis we used count of event id and for legend  first get overdue status by creating calculated column  
		
		Status_Overdue = IF(Event[Status Code]="Closed","Closed",IF(TODAY()-Event[Date Reported]>30,"Overdue",Event[Status Code]))
		
	Q9.	Can you explain how you implemented interactive filters in Power BI and their impact on the report’s usability?

-->		Department , Year Filter, Page level filter - We filter source system Name- It was code like INX_PHO
		


		
	Q10. What specific DAX functions did you use to calculate the days since the last significant event and analyze days since incident is open?
	
-->		 Max of event date and current date dateDiff
		 
		

	Q11. How did you handle complex calculations and ensure their accuracy in your reports?
	
-->		 
		
		
	Q12. Can you describe the process of writing and optimizing SQL queries to fetch and aggregate data for your reports?
	
	Q13. How did you ensure the data extracted from multiple tables was accurate and ready for visualization?
	
	Q14. What KPIs did you track in the “Hill Safety Report,” and why were they important for the stakeholders?
	
	Q15. How did you present these KPIs in a way that was easy for stakeholders to understand and act upon?
	
	Q16. How did you manage and integrate large datasets from the SQL database into Power BI?
	
	Q17. Can you discuss any specific techniques or tools you used to handle data segmentation by status (open, in progress, resolved)?
	
	Q18. What was the overall impact of the “Hill Safety Report” on the mining company’s safety and operational transparency?
	
	Q10. Can you share any feedback or results from stakeholders after implementing the report?
